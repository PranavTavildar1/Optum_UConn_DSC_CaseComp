# BEFORE YOU CODE: Optum Data Analytics Case Competition Description and Guidelines

Welcome to the first Optum Data Analytics Case Competition at the University of Connecticut! 
We are very excited to see what kinds of creative and innovative solutions you are will come up this week to solve the problem statement!
This README will describe all the files we've provided and outlines some of the best practices we would like to encourage from our end.

### Code Directory
This is where you'll put your code. You may use whatever language or software you would like to conduct data analysis, though we recommend Python or R. Your project may end up as a part of [Optum Open Source](https://opensource.optum.com/) so it is important to document your code well so is easily understandable by other developers.

### Presentation
This directory is where you will put a pdf of your final presentation and/or any code you used to generate your final presentation. The grading rubric and guidelines can also be found here.

### Data Files
For this competition we are using data from the publicly available [County Health Rankings Dataset]()

**2022 County Health Rankings Data.xlsx**: This is a data dictionary of all the health measures for 2022. It includes a rank list of multiple health and social factors for all US counties. It allows comparison within a state. It is very well formatted for rapid Exploratory Data Analysis [Click here to see the Documentation](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/media/document/DataDictionary_2022.pdf)

**chr_analytic_data2022.csv**: This data is similar to that above but it is in csv form. Furthermore it is in a raw formatting so data transformation will be needed. [Click here to see the Documentation](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation#:~:text=2022%20CHR%20CSV/SAS%20Analytic%20Data%20Documentation)

**chr_trends_csv_2022.csv**: This data provides the trends in the health measures year over year across all counties. [Click here to see the Documentation](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation#:~:text=2021%20CHR%20Trends%20Data%20Documentation)

### Miscellaneous  
**LICENSE**: We will be using the open source Apache 2.0 License for this competition. [Click here to learn more](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)

**.gitignore**: This file is used to determine what file types to ignore when pushing your code to the main github repository in order to keep it clean
